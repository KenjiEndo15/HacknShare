Hey, you can call me Kenji. I’m just a dude working in cybersecurity. I like learning new things, that's why I decided to create this blog - to share what I've picked up along the way.

My main interests are cybersecurity, the Japanese language, and drawing. You'll find various topics covered in my blog, so feel free to choose the ones that interest you.

By the way, Kenji Endo is the hero from the famous manga made by Naoki Urasawa, 20th Century Boys. Make sure to read it; it’s worth it.

Welcome aboard!
