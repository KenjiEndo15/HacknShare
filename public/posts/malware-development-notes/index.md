# Malware Development Notes


This page will be regularly updated with my notes on malware development. Keep in mind that I&#39;m still learning, so some information might not be entirely accurate.

## Code Signing
The signature of a binary can be used to enhance its reputation, even if it contains potentially malicious data.

## Encryption
To conceal malicious code within a file, encryption techniques can be employed. This makes it more difficult for security solutions and reverse engineers to understand the underlying behavior.

{{&lt; admonition warning &gt;}}
Encryption can significantly increase entropy, which may in turn facilitate detection.

## Obfuscation
To conceal malicious code within a file, obfuscation techniques can be employed. This makes it more difficult for security solutions and reverse engineers to understand the underlying behavior.

## Offensive CI/CD pipeline
To ensure better maintenance and efficiency, adopting a CI/CD pipeline is highly recommended.
